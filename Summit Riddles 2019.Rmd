  geom_text(data = riddle_log2 %>% filter(Wins_increase > 0),      # Pick only where "Wins" is increasing
            aes(y = Wins+ .3, label = riddle_name),                # We add 0.2 to lift the labels a bit

            color = "black")+                                       # Left-adjust and rotate labels
